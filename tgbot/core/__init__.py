Please note:

    Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
    Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
    Inside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
    In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.
    In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_**__, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.
    A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.
    Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.
